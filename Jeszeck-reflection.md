* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    - I was really struggling with pull requests and figuring out how to push files to github so that you could create a pull request. 
* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    - Yes, we practiced pull requests a lot, and now I understand that you have to push the feature branch to create a pull request, not the master. 
* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    - I asked for clarification regarding fetch/merge and pull. I don't know how many things I specifically asked my pair or guide because everything felt very fluid and we talked through a lot of concepts altogether. 
* What still confuses you about Git?
    - I'm definitely getting more clear on git, but sometimes I get confused about different branches and how to correctly merge them into the master. 
* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
    - It was really good! My partner and I worked really well together, and our guide did a really good job of stepping in only when we got very confused about a topic, or started explaining it incorrectly. It was a little scary to be watched the whole time, but overall it wasn't too stressful. I learned a lot!
